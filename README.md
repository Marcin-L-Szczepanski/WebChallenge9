## CSS Grid

## CSS organization

In order to structure CSS code, I used a combination of two methodologies: BEM and ITCSS.

Using a methodology of writing CSS code helps to have better understanding of CSS architecture, prepare smaller file sizes, mantain the code easier.

### BEM

### ITCSS
ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS) is a methodology proposed by Harry Roberts.


## Webpack
- Bundles multiple js / css files into one main js / css file
- Compiles ES6 to code that can run in older browser

webpack.config.js

### CSS

`npm install css-loader --save-dev`
